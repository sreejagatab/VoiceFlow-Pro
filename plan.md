### Scenario 2: Healthcare Appointment Scheduling
**Context**: Patient calling to schedule specialist consultation
```
Agent: "Good morning! I'm calling to help schedule your cardiology consultation. Dr. Martinez has availability next week. Do you prefer morning or afternoon appointments?"

Patient: "Morning would be better. I need to do my pre-op bloodwork first though. Can we do that the same day?"

Agent: "Absolutely. I can schedule your lab work at 9 AM and your consultation with Dr. Martinez at 10:30 AM on Tuesday, March 15th. This allows proper time for lab results. Does that work with your schedule?"
```

**Showcases**: Medical terminology, complex scheduling logic, procedural understanding

### Scenario 3: Customer Support Escalation
